# Portfolio of Machine Learning Projects

Hello!

My name is Sergey Tuktarov. Welcome to my page showcasing my work in the field of machine and deep learning.

I am proficient in Python and actively use libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, scikit-learn, Keras, PyTorch (Torch Lightning), and Transformers. I also have experience with SQL, Tableau, Power BI, and Git.

I hold a master's degree in energy machine engineering. My interests are focused on Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Computer Vision (CV). These are rapidly evolving fields, so I strive to stay updated with the latest news and take new courses on platforms like Hugging Face.

On this page, you can see my projects, including image classification, credit risk management models, targeting action prediction, and more.

If you have any questions or collaboration proposals, please feel free to reach out to me at tuktarovs@yahoo.com.
